184,"Once the stainless-steel <e1>vessel</e1> was filled with <e2>nitrogen</e2>, the outer volume of the chamber stayed constant in pressure."\
185,"The stainless-steel <e1>vessel</e1> was enriched by <e2>nitrogen</e2>, so that the external pressure of the chamber remained unchanged."\
186,"<e2>Nitrogen</e2> filled the stainless-steel <e1>vessel</e1>, ensuring the chamber's outer environment stayed at a stable pressure."\
187,"By supplying <e2>nitrogen</e2> to the stainless-steel <e1>vessel</e1>, the pressure in the outer region of the chamber was not disturbed."\
188,"The stainless-steel <e1>vessel</e1> had <e2>nitrogen</e2> inside, preserving the stable pressure in the chamber's external volume."\
189,"We made certain the stainless-steel <e1>vessel</e1> was loaded with <e2>nitrogen</e2>, maintaining the chamber's outer zone at constant pressure."\
190,"The stainless-steel <e1>vessel</e1> was soaked with <e2>nitrogen</e2>, and the area outside the chamber was kept at steady pressure."\
191,"After <e2>nitrogen</e2> was placed in the stainless-steel <e1>vessel</e1>, the outside portion of the chamber remained under stable pressure."\
192,"The stainless-steel <e1>vessel</e1> got a full amount of <e2>nitrogen</e2>, ensuring that the external chamber region's pressure was constant."\
193,"<e2>nitrogen</e2> was transferred into the stainless-steel <e1>vessel</e1>, keeping the chamber's outer environment at a steady pressure reading."\
194,"We preserved steady pressure outside the chamber by filling its stainless-steel <e1>vessel</e1> with <e2>nitrogen</e2>."\
195,"The stainless-steel <e1>vessel</e1> was replete with <e2>nitrogen</e2>, and the surrounding chamber volume's pressure stayed stable."\
196,"By having <e2>nitrogen</e2> inside the stainless-steel <e1>vessel</e1>, no fluctuations were noticed in the chamber's external pressure."\
197,"A stable external pressure was kept in the chamber once the stainless-steel <e1>vessel</e1> was filled with <e2>nitrogen</e2>."\
198,"The stainless-steel <e1>vessel</e1> was charged to capacity with <e2>nitrogen</e2>, ensuring the chamber's outer volume's pressure remained unchanged."\
199,"We made the stainless-steel <e1>vessel</e1> hold <e2>nitrogen</e2>, thus retaining a stable pressure in the external zone of the chamber."\
200,"The stainless-steel <e1>vessel</e1> was fully provided with <e2>nitrogen</e2>, and the outer volume of the chamber stayed at a steady pressure."}
